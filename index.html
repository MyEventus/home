        <p>This site is not yet open to the public. See <a href="docs/getting-started">Getting Started</a> page.
        <p><b>Aim:</b> A SIMPLE way to replace the current multiple Emails, SMS and phone calls when organise events such as Mountain Bike Rides, Drinks, Water sports, Parties, gathering etc for a small group of friends.</p>

        <br>
        <p>We don't all use FBook or other social networking apps!</p>
        <br>
        <p>If we don't know you (friends of friends), you probably will get rejected.</p>
        <p>Having said that, if there is enough demand and financial viable then I may be open to public in future.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>This sites original intention was to be absolutley free of charge, cost and currently is,</p>
        <p>But as user limits and threshold raise (number members join, number of entries in database, number of emails sent.</p>
        <p>It will start encuring costs, at which point will become a financial loss, hence only open to limited group at present.</p>
        <p>For this reason (and time constraints) this site as linited functionality.</p>
        <br>

        <li>The sky's the limit given funding and time.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
